# 100DaysOfCode

## Welcome to 100DaysOfCode Challenge within the GitFitCode Community, here we will embark on a journey to better ourselves through constant progress.
#
## To get started:
### Create a folder with your name.
### Create a contract.txt within the folder and copy the contract in OriginalContract.txt, fill it out. :)
### Create a folder called days within your named folder.
#### Here you will add a txt file for each day of the 100 days, explaining what was done that day and what you hope to accomplish the next day.


### When commiting, create a branch under your name to commit to.
