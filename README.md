# 100DaysOfCode

## Welcome to 100DaysOfCode Challenge within the GitFitCode Community, here we will embark on a journey to better ourselves through constant progress

## To get started

### 1. Pull the repo locally

### 2. Branch from MAIN using your name as branch title

### 3. Create a folder with your name

### 4. Create a contract.txt within the folder and copy the contract in OriginalContract.txt, fill it out. :)

### 5. Create a folder called days inside your named folder

#### Here you will add a txt file for each day of the 100 days, explaining what was done that day and what you hope to accomplish the next day

### 6. Create a pull request to merge with MAIN

## After the initial format is created, continue on

### 1. Pull and Branch from MAIN using your name as title

### 2. Update by adding a Day###.txt file to your day folder

### 3. Create a pull request to merge with MAIN

## Good luck and for any help, please let us know on Discord
