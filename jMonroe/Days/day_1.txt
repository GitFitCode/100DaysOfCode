Focus: C Programming Language (book)
Pages Completed: 27 - 31 ish, kind of forgot...

Learned about file copying, which unfortunately still doesn't make sense since
because the book explains how to write the program but not what is expected as
input.

Fortunately that doesn't matter too much as I can discern these details later
and am mostly worried about memorizing basic syntax at this point. For and while
loops are second nature already since they're structured similarly to JS but
I'm still slightly confused about what happens when using: `#define` for variables.
