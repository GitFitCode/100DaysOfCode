Ok, not sure what is up with me this week. So worn out. Regardless, I had planned
to start with the exercises at the end of the last chapter but just don't have
that much critical thinking in me at the moment. Stupid, I know. Onto chapter 2.

First character of a variable name must be a letter.
C is case sensitive.

Basic data types:
char -- single byte can hold one character.
int -- an integer. Size varies based on machine.
    As well, can be short or long. Often 16 bits or 32 bits.
float -- single precision float.
double -- double precision floating point.
