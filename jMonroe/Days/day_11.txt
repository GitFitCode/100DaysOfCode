Ok, understood this intuitively, but now it's spelled out.
'x' is an integer used to produce the numeric value of the letter x.
"x" is an array of characters containing only x.

I'm totally baffled by enumeration values. They seem to be iterators. Something you can iterate over. Where if the iterations are undefined it will start at 0 & continue up numerically. 

Or you can define an enum whith your own values to specify what values it will iterate over???

Well hopefully that makes more sense in the future because without examples used within programs I'm lost.

Onto section 2.4 and will do that tm.
