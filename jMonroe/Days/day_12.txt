Ok, so variable declaration specifies a type of a variable. 
Variables can be initialized in the declaration.

External & static variables are initialized to zero by default.
Automatic variables have undefined (garbage) values by default.

Adding const to the front of a variable declaration means it cannot be changed.
Adding const to an array argument indicates that a function does not change the
array.


# Section 2.5 -- Arithmetic Operators
integer division truncates any fractional part.
modulus is still %


# Section 2.6 -- Relational & Logical Operators
relational operators: > >= < <= have the same precedence
equality operators: == != are just below relational operators in precedence.
Logical operators: || && are evaluated left to right & evaluation stops once
a truth or falsehood result is known.

# Section 2.7 -- Type Conversions
basically, type conversions are limited. Converting from a more limited type
to more open type is fine (int to float). But vice versa not so much.
