Focus: Custom AHK script and some python to help
Time: 8:45pm - 9:30pm

Ok, got totally distracted today. Been interested in chording keyboards and
starting writing an auto hot key script to try that out with a regular keyboard.
Wound up writing a little python as well because I'm an idiot and was
calculating the number of key combinations as though i was using key
permutations. Silly.

Anyways. Was all pointless. But it was some coding.
