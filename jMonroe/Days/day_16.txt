Well, moved through section 2.8 quickly and into section 2.9, bitwise operators.
I've gone over these so many times in python and they still aren't intuitive
for me. Perhaps someday I'll be forced to work extensively with binary values.

Ok, I like this quick example:
if x is 1 and y is 2 then x & y is zero while x && y is one.
since & is a bitwise and. so 0001 bitwise and 0010 result in 0000.
but 1 and 2 result in one (true).

Good news. Messed around with bitwise operators in python a bit more and they
I do at least understand how they work at a basic level. Couldn't anticipate
how they'll affect larger numbers though.
