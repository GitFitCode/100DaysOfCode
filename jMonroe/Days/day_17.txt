Focus: Python hot keys for chorded keyboard.
Time: 12:00pm - 2:00pm

Yeah, got distracted again today. Still trying to determine whether a chorded
keyboard could be the functional input device I'm envisioning for portability
and ease of use.

So, I started a project today & began learning about pynput for capturing
keyboard input and sending keystrokes based on that. Unfortunately the final
project almost certainly wouldn't be written in python. But if I can put
together a script that will allow me to start performing tests without having
to purchase any components or fabricate any parts then I think it will be
time well spent.

Still planning to continue working through the c programming book but perhaps
this could become the project to work on after completing the book.
