Ok, kinda just blasted through bitwise operators. Boring shit.
Section 2.10 -- Assignment Operators & Expressions
+= is an example of assignment operators

could be -= *= /= %= etc

2.11 - Conditional Expressions
Oh boy! the ternary operator!!
written:
expr1 ? expr2 : expr3

so, if expr1 evaluates to true the expr2 is evaluated.
else, expr3 is evaluated.
