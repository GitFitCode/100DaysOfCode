Started on section 1.5.3 -- Line Counting.
Ok, the line counting program works as expected. I'm still not 100% sure how to 
enter an End of File (EOF) character, or how to input a file to the program. In
this case though entering several lines of text and ctrl+c ing out of the program
displays the correct number of lines.

Whoa, ok. getchar collects input and putchar outputs it. Apparently while the
program is running you can input things with the keyboard and then the enter
key counts as an EOF input causing it to output the collected input.

Tried to work on exercise 1-9 but couldn't figure out how they expect to take
input and output it replacing double spaces with single spaces. Have to return
to this.
