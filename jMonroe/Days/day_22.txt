Focus: Keyboard hotkey thing
Time: 9:45am - 10:45am

Ok, I still want to continue working through the c book but boy do I spend more
time on this when I'm doing something that actually interests me.

I think I actually made some good progress on the keyboard hotkey overlay thing
today. I got something working in cpp that seems to be quite responsive but for
now only reads if one key is pressed and then replaces that key with something
else.

I'll need to start keeping track of the state of keys pressed and define some
two and three key hotkeys before knowing if this will actually work.
