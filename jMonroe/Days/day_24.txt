Ok, interesting, you can use commas to separate multiple expressions in say, a for loop.
So you can process two indices in parallel.
Something like:
`for (i = 0, j = strlen(s)-1; i < j; i++, j--)`


Can't say for sure if I'm actually learning any of this stuff but I am
reading it.
On to chapter 4 now. Oh boy.
