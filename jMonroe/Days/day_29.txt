Focus: Retro Game Coders tutorial
Time: 11:17am

Ok, that tutorial turned out to be something of a waste of time. Didn't realize
it was designed primarily to be run on retro systems... Doesn't do me much good
without a commodore or amiga. Whatever, back to my book for a bit.

Since I'm on my windows computer this morning I decided to go over the same
function I wrote yesterday on my linux machine. It was for the best in this case
because in rewriting it I better understood it and left lots of comments to
help me understand it in the moment & hopefully make it more intelligible upon
returning to it.
