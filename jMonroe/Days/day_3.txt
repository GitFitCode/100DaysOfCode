Focus: C Programming Language (book)
Time Spent: 7:25am - 7:58am
Pages: all over, backtracking to better understand previous topics.

Ok, I understand better now. They kept referring to getchar as a way to get input
from a file (or something like that). But it's like input in python. Meant to
recieve input from the keyboard. 

So getchar waits for input and collects it when you press enter.
Then, if you've saved that input to a variable you can output it with putchar.

I'm realizing that measuring my progress by number of pages covered probably
isn't the best metric for this 100 days agreement. I've gone backwards on page
count today to better understand the material and now, to cover the number of
pages I'd planned on would take more time than I have.

So, time metric from here on out! Aiming for 30 minutes per day.
