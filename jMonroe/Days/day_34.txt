First day of fall term yesterday and completely forgot to do my 100 days of code.
Also, now realizing that I was partway through a program that is saved on my linux
computer. So, I'll be right back on that machine.


Ok, the calculator program matches what they've written in the book but is
not functional. I did start troubleshooting but have gotten nowhere. We'll
see how much patience I have for trying to make an essentially useless
program work.
Back at it tm.
