Oh, yeah. The fucking calculator still doesn't work. I was wondering why my
starting page was two less than yesterday's. Debugging. Not sure I'm going to
put any more time into that. Let's see if it magically works.

Nope it doesn't work. Fuck it. If it was a program I cared about I'd put in
the time.


Ok, well. The next section of the book is essentially breaking that program
out into it's own files. I'll do that but can't see how it will fix the
broken program. Perhaps I'll begin to understand it well enough along the way
to actually troubleshoot it.
