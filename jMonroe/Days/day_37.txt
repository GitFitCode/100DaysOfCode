Ok, I forgot to record anything yesterday. I'm going to count the work I'm
doing for the National Cyber League competition towards my 100 days of code.
It's technically for my class but I'm doing more than is required for the
class and I could use a break from that c programming book. I might replace
that book in fact. It's bugging the hell out of me.

Anyways, I forgot to create a day 36 yesterday but am going to count it as
completed due to the time I spent bash scripting and log analyzing. Now back
to a bit more log analyzing today and maybe something else depending on how
long the last two practice challenges take.

Ok, completed the last two challenges and found a new book for learning c.
Hopefully it's better than the first one. I still can't figure out why that one
was recommended anywhere. They seem to leave out some very important stuff as
you work through it that makes many of the exercises at the end of each section
impossible to complete.
