Ok, another short learning day. This one got put off till the last possible
minute again. But hey. I'm glad to get started on this new book. It's always
a little frustrating starting from scratch but I'd rather do that than
continue pushing forward with a resource that isn't working for me.

Now I'm off to hopefully install a new os on this computer.
