Ok, these programs that accept input are still confusing me somewhat but I am
beginning to understand them better. I had been using ctrl-c to exit the programs
which had previously worked alright since nothing was happening after the while
loop that collected input and spit it back out. The latest program did things after
the while loop though.

So, since they keep using EOF to end the while loop I had to figure out how to
input that.
On windows that seems to be ctrl+z. So now my program counts lines, words, and
characters just fine.

Very short learning time today.
