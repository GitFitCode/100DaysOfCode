Chapter 4
Ok, this is kind of interesting.
They're describing, damn I can't think of what they're called in python
either.

So, the characters you use to inject variables into a print statement.
They're calling those conversion characters. Interesting name.
So like:
- %d -- integer
- %f -- floating-point
  - same thing as python for string formatting. %.3f prints floating point number with 3 decimal places.
- %c -- character
- %s -- string

double interesting because I thought it was %i for integer.

Well that's the end of the chapter. Stuff I already know, but again, doesn't hurt to review the basics.
