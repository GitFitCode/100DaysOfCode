Ok, this is actually good to know.
When you do an #include if you wrap the filename in quotes rather than <>
C will first search the disk directory where your program is stored for that
file. Then it will search the built-in #include directory


One thing this book had mentioned before that I kind of glossed over.
include string.h and then you can use the strcpy function to set a string
variable to a new value. Super handy.
