Good to know. Don't use escape sequences with scanf like \n, \a, \t, they
confuse scanf. In particular scanf stops recording input when user presses
enter so don't use \n.

Also, though not required it's good practice to put a space before the data
type to be captured. so `scanf(" %d", &integervariable);

Also, very weird, use the ampersand if you're capturing integers,
characters, and whatnot but not when capturing strings.

Ok, the semi technical reason, you don't put the ampersand in front of
pointer variables. An array is a pointer variable.

Another issue with reading strings. scanf stops reading after the first
space.
