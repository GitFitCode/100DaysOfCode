I think perhaps conditional operators will always confuse the hel out of me.
Now that I type that out aren't <> and what not conditional operators?
Ah, no, they're relational operators and || && are logical operators, ok.

So back to conditional operators, which always throw me off.
relation ? true_statement : false_statement;
easy.

if relation ? do true : else do false; // that makes more sense to me.

Oh cool conditional operators can go in printf()s:
printf("I ate %d pear%s\n", num_pears, (num_pears > 1) ? ("s.") : ("."));
I'm not quite sure why each expression for the conditional operator is in
parentheses there. But that would make the sentence plural or not if you ate
more than one pear.
