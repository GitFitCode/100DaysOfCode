Whoops, no excuse I totally forgot to do my coding yesterday.

Well read about while and for loops but didn't learn anything new there.
Straightforward stuff. Someday I'll actually have to start paying attention again.

Actually, looking ahead it appears there may be interesting stuff coming up soon.
I guess I have made it through most of the introductory stuff.
