Ok, very interesting and a little confusing. According to the book, 'chars are
just small integers'. 

They use a comparison: `if (c >= '0' && c <= '9')`
where c is type char. That just seems wrong. But it works.

So they say the above comparison determines if the character in c is a digit.
This is going to take some getting used to.

Ok, I read a bit further and it makes slightly more sense.
'0' is a char, and a char is just a small integer, meaning that char can be used
in arithmetic operations exactly as though it was an integer.

Excellent. I guess. Still looks like a string to me...
