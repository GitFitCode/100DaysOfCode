Ok, this is handy. I always forget about continue. Or maybe python doesn't
have continue and I only think it does, can't remember.
But anyways, if you're in a loop and have some code that executed and you
just want to keep going without executing the rest of the code before
starting again use continue.

I think I've explained it poorly, but I understand what it's supposed to do.
Continue will go to the start of the loop at the next iteration. It doesn't 
start the loop over but continues from the top of the loop code block
without executing the rest of the code in that block. That's better.


Ok, going over switch/case statement again is always a good thing. It always
throws me off. It's so simple and it seems like there should be more to it.
I think I just need to actually use it somehwere. I've typed out their
example programs many times and that is fine. But I don't think the syntax
will stick till I use it in my own project.
