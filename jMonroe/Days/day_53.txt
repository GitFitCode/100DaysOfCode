Interesting. Learning about getchar and putchar. Which are a little weird.
I'm not exactly sure why they'd ever be preferable over scanf and printf.
They seem to have more or less the same function but are limited to a single
character of input/output. Perhaps I'm not fully understanding their best
use case yet.
