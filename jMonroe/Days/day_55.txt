sweet, strcat to concatenate string arrays. When used it modifies the
variable itself. Adding the second strin to the first. No need for
assignment.

ok, gets and puts are the functions I've been looking for. We'll see if they
have some fatal flaws as well, but they sound pretty awesome. They work with
whole strings rather than only characters.

Here's the fatal fucking flaw. It's a deprecated function that no longer
exists in c... WTF. fgets did replace it and works well. But it also saves
the newline character at the end which is less than ideal.

Commencing research to figure out how to get rid of that fucking \n.

Yesssss, this is when I love this shit. When you have a question and are
actually able to answer it with a functional solution.

So, to get rid of the newline character captured by fgets use the awesome
function:
strcspn

Say you've captured input and saved it in the variable input_var.
Now there's a pesky fucking newline character at the end of it.
Use:
input_var[strcspn(input_var, "\n")] = 0;     to get rid of it.

This is still a little confusing to me. Usually strings end with a \0
character. So I'm not 100% sure why replacing the \n with a literal 0 ends
the string. But it does, so no complaints.
