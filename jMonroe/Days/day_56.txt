Ok, interesting. So I learned that gets was deprecated so fgets is the
replacement. Now I learn that scanf can't accept strings with spaces while
gets can. WTF C. Why are there so many different ways to do basically the
same thing. These are all functions designed to get input from a use and yet
they all have different shortcomings and none quite function without some
additional work to capture the data you need.

I may be starting to hate this programming language. I wrote some python
earlier today and was flipping out by how easy it is to declare variables
and functions as well as how there's always a built in function to
manipulate data just the way you need. Get your shit together C.f



Ok, some momentary redemption. At least the math builtins are there.
floor() and ceil() do exactly what you'd expect.

A little weird, but functional:
fabs() returns the floating point absolute value.
And there's pow() and sqrt().
And then there's a bunch of standard trigonometric functions along the lines
of sqrt & pow. cos, sin, tan, etc.



Finally something that may be beneficial. Learning about rand.
first of, rand() requires stdlib.h

You see rand with srand which must be passed a different number each time
you run the program. This means you must also include time.h to seed it.
