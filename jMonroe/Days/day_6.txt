Focus: C Programming language (book)
Starting at: page 35, section 1.6
Time: 9:10pm - 9:35pm

Moved on to section 1.7, functions. There are exercises at the end of each section
but thus far they seem to be mostly out of my grasp. Perhaps I'm simply not putting
enough effort into writing the suggested programs but from my perspective it seems
I've not yet been given the tools to do so.

For now I think I'll continue moving forward and hopefully be able to return and
complete previous exercises with ease.
