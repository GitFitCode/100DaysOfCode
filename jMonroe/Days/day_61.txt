Some actual good stuff today. Similar to yesterday but the book built on it.
The program today was one which takes customer ID's and their corresponding
bank balance, sorts them, and then lets you search for a given customer
via their id.

The improvement over a similar previous program is the fact that the data is
sorted before letting you search it. This may improve search times with a
large dataset.

Good stuff.
