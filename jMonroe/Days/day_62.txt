Ok, started learning about pointers today. I'm still not quite sure why
they're necessary. I mean can't you just reference the variable by name?
Why do you need another separate named variable that only stores another
variable's location in memory?

We'll see. Hopefully they have some good examples of the use cases going
forward.
Time to go celebrate my dad's birthday though, that can wait till tm.
