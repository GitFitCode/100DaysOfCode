Oh ok. I didn't realize you could use pointers like this:
*p_age = 25;
To set the value of the variable where p_age points to. That makes them seem
more useful already but I still can't imagine any real use cases for them.

Ok, the good news is I understand at a basic level how pointers work.
The other good news is that the writers have assured me they will unveil
the true potential of pointers in a future chapter when also covering
functions. So yay.
