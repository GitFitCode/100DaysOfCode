Ok, c is stupid. There are too many ways to do the same thing and none of
them ever seem to work quite how you want them to.
Pointers are getting weird with the fact that they can point to an array and
assign things to that array. All despite the fact that you can't actually
modify an array directly?!? Maybe I'm missing something here. Idk.

Left off with a not working pointer_demo_2. Going to troubleshoot that tm.
