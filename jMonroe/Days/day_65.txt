Ok, the troubleshooting is complete. Mostly. I get weird warnings all the time when compiling my programs that are for c++ even though my files end in .c.
I'm not sure why that is but it's not ideal. It makes it harder to parse the real issues. Regardless. My pointer_demo_2 is working. I can rate movies and
stuff.

Ok, next chapter, time to learn about the heap, where my corpse will forever
burn in the hellscape of unused c libraries.

Alright, the only way to access the heap is via pointer variables. WTF.
