Well fuck. Could they flip the script and make me like c again all in a few
pages. I'd always heard you could manage memory directly with c but hadn't
seen anything resembling that yet. Now we learn about the heap and dynamic
memory allocation on the heap. Fucking cool.

Ok, malloc() -- memory allocate, and free() -- deallocates memory.

To use malloc you need to have a pointer that points to the first heap
value. Something like:
int * temps;
Then allocate 10 integers on the heap like this:
temps = (int *) malloc(10 * sizeof(int)); 

That's some wonky shit as usual. 
So, we want to allocate enough bytes for 10 integers, we don't know the size
of an integer since it varies per system so we use sizeof to get the number
of bytes and then multiply that by ten.

malloc always performs two steps (if there's enough heap memory):
1. Allocates the number of bytes you request & makes sure no other program
can overwrite the allocated memory until your program frees it.
2. Assigns your pointer to the first allocated value.


This will take some getting used to. Not sure yet how to make use of this
but it's interesting stuff.
