Quickly moved on to section 1.8, Arguments.
So, my understanding. When defining a function you specify the parameters to be
included as arguments when that function is called. Arguments provided when a function
is called aren't directly modified. Temporary variables are used and modified within
the function without modifying the original.

To modify the original variable from within a function you would need to pass in
a pointer to that variable as an argument.

Except with arrays. When the name of an array is used as an argument the value
passed to the function is the address of the beginning of the array.
No copying of array elements occurs.


On to section 1.9 -- character arrays.
Leaving off at the end of 1.9 before attempting the exercises.
