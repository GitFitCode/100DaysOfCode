Ok cool, getting hands on with malloc today. Allocating memory to store
integers. Simple but good practice. The concepts aren't too hard to
understand but boy do I hate c syntax. 

int * random_nums;
random_nums = (int *) malloc(10 * sizeof(int));
^^ that's stupid. Not concise. Bad c.

at least:
free(random_nums);
is easy for freeing up the memory.
