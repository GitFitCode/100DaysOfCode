Totally forgot I finished the chapter on memory allocation.
On to structures. Are structures basically classes? C doesn't have classes
right? It's not object oriented. Fuck if I know.

Ok, well structs aren't so bad but scanf is fucking me.
Going to troubleshoot that some more tomorrow but kind of done with it for now.
