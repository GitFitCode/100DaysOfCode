Huh, I can't figure out the scanf thing. They put a dollar sign in the scanf
string when it's called but that causes the program to skip the next scanf
call for me. It works fine without that so that's how it's going to be.

Ok, fuck, I figured it out. If you include the dollar sign in the scanf call
it's assumed that the user will type in a dollar sign there. Which I was not
doing, which then messes up the next scanf call. God I knew it was simple.

I'm getting this down. To some extent. I still kind of hate this programming
language.
What's up with the weird little things like & to save to a pointer variable
and then -> to save to the heap. Whatever, get used to it.
