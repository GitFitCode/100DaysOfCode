So, I mentioned in the last note but will type it out here as well to help
me remember:

To open a file use:
fopen() -- which is included in stdio.h.
  -- also has read, write, and append modes like python.

Write to files using:
fprintf() -- takes a couple of arguments:
  -- the file pointer and a string to enter into the file.

And remember to close files with:
fclose() -- which takes a file pointer as an argument.

First step is to define a file pointer:
FILE *file_pointer;




This was a productive and fun session. I like that things are getting a little more complex now.
