Huh, ok. I'm a little confused again. Just starting to learn about random
files. Apparently when you open a sequential file you can only read it but
when you open a random file you can read from anywhere in it and write to
anywhere in it.

To read or write a file randomly use:
"r+", "w+", or "a+"

And to move around an opened file use:
fseek(filePtr, longVal, origin);
-- filePtr - is the pointer used in fopen().
-- longVal - specifies the number of bytes to skip forward or backward in the file (a longint variable either positive or negative)
-- origin - will always be one of these: (all defined in stdio.h)
  -- SEEK_SET - beginning of file
  -- SEEK_CUR - current position in file
  -- SEEK_END - end of file

If you position the file pointer over existing data new data written there
will replace the existing data.
