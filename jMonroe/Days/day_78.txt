Ok, more random file goodies. Still interesting stuff. I need to review the
program I just wrote to fully understand one part of it.
letter = fgetc(fptr);

We must have read about it but I don't rememer fgetc at all.
Interesting the fptr doesn't have to be incremented or anything.
fgetc apparently forwards it to the next character pointer.

Going to look that up tomorrow.
