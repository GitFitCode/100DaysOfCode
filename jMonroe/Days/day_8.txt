Whew, still things I'm so confused about when approaching the exercises.
Exercise 1-17 says to: Write a program to print all input lines longer than
80 characters.

Ok, my first instict would be to create an array of strings where any input string
longer than 80 characters would be added to the array and then print each member
of that array. Maybe that's possible in C but I'm not sure how.

What I've realized is that it doesn't matter if the 80 character input lines are
stored as separate variables. I'll keep adding each character to one long character
array separating each line with a \n and then print the entire array.:q

Alright! Progress! That worked. I got the program working that prints all lines
which are longer than a specified number of characters. I was right to put them
all in a single array and separate them via a delimiter (in this case \n). 

I got hung up for a moment trying to determine how to add them to the existing
array without overwriting the chars already in that array but an integer to track
the index of the end of the last line solved that.

Might have to return to other earlier exercises to see if perhaps I couldn't solve
them simply because I wasn't thinking about the problem in the right way.
