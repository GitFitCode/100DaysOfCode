Focus: C Programming Abs Beginner Guide (book)
Time: 4:45pm - 5:19pm
Starting at: pg 287

Good news. I think I figured out what to do after finishing this book.
There are some certifications I found specifically for python programming
and c programming. Since I've been focused on C programming this whole time
I think I'll start with that one. They sound like they're fairly entry level
but should give me some continued focus as I brush up on topics to ensure
testing success.

Wow. Good thing I found those certs too. Looks like I'm almost done with
this book. Still a little ways to go but pg 293 of 352 is getting there.




Ok, good stuff today. Learning about passing variables between functions
which is both excessively complex and totally simple.
