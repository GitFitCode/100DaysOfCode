Interesting to note: you can pass multiple arguments to functions but can return
only one. I'm assuming that includes an array of pointers or whatever though.

Also good to note. Main can't return void.

Ok, ***function prototyping*** makes sense now. I was wondering why they were seemingly
wasting their time on that.

functions that return int don't really need to be prototyped but you should
anyway.
For functions that return anything other than int if they are prototyped c checks
to make sure you're not passing in a variable of the wrong type.

If you don't prototype your functions passing a float to a function expecting
a char will result in c attempting to conver that float to a char.

Depening on on the conversion that occurs it may not end well.
