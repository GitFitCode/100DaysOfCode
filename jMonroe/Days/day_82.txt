Wow ok. That turned out to be the end of the actual content in that book.
Kind of took me by surprise!

There's one long program they show that I could copy down but I don't really
want to type enough just to copy out someone else's nonsense program.



I know I said c certification next but I had an idea today while doing a
school assignment that I want to put a little time into.

The course is wilderness survival and the assignment was to plot bearings
on our compass, take a certain number of steps, and ultimately report on
where we ended up.

I was clear from the bearings that we would be ending up back where we
started.


My thought was that I could write a program that would generate series of
compass headings and a number of steps to take for each. It would then
calculate the end distance from the students start point.

This way the students would have randomized directions and the assignment
could have them turn to face their starting point, set a compass bearing 
for it, and then count the paces back to it.

They would submit that final heading & number of steps as the answer
to each series of coordinates. 



It would measure distances using integer math in paces so that it should
work for anyone.

I think I could essentially do it with x and y coordinates.
Generate the random coordinate pairs and calculate the distance and angle
to get from one pair of points to another and there we go.

That shouldn't be too crazy.
I'll start the planning for it tomorrow.
I think I can write it in c. It seems like a good chance to try out my new
skills.
