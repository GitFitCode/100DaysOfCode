Ok this feels weird not to have a book to start working on.
But I'm excited for this project. 

I think I'll write it in C and then offer to translate it if the teacher
happens to be interested in that.

I'm still not sure exactly what this will entail so let's try to flesh it
out a little more.


Let's say it will generate 3 to 5 pairs of bearings and steps to take.
So we'll generate a random number to decide how many and then use that
number to instantiate an array of that length.

It'll be an array of arrays. The outer array is 3 to 5 elements and each
inner array will be 4 elements. The coordinate pair, the number of paces,
and the bearing.

Ok, decision time. There are a couple of ways I could go about generating
the coordinates and whatnot.
I could generate a coordinate pair and then calculate the distance in paces
between it & the previous one.
Or
I could generate a number of paces and bearing and then figure out the new
coordinates from there.

I think generating the coordinates will be the way to go. Each coordinate
pair will be a number of paces on an x y grid anyway so figuring out the
distance between them will be trivial. I'm not quite sure how it will go
finding the bearing but I don't think it will be too bad.

Probably find the distance between the coordinate points then solve the
triangle to figure out the angle to go from one to another. I might have to
draw that out to understand it.

So let's start with a coordinate generating function.




Ok, minimal progress but it's something. It's remarkable how little I
remember after going through that book. I so much prefer working on projects
for learning. Maybe should have taken the project approach from the start.
But here we are!
