Ok, lots of progress. The program is mostly functional but will still need some
tweaking.

The first test didn't take me back to my start point which is confounding.
I'm not yet sure why that is but will try to get to the bottom of it tomorrow.

I think it also needs the ability to generate negative numbers. Otherwise you
can only go east and north from the starting point.

But it's getting there. Maybe I'll start tracking it with this repo as well.
We'll see. I don't expect it to actually be used by the teacher but hey it's an
interesting project nevertheless.

It has forced me to think about trigonometry, radians, and degrees for the first
time in a long time!
