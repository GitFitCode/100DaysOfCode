holy crap. I just realized I put 10 for the month on day 86. How long have
I been putting the wrong date?!?


Ok for my project I need to create a couple of test cases so that I can
verify my program is working as intended without having to do the math for
random coordinates every time.

I already have test data that will show bearings heading east, north, west,
and south. Now I need test data that will give me bearings in between those.

Oh yeah! I need to be able to generate negative coordinates as well. Let's
actually start with that since it should be a couple changed lines and then
do the test data.

Ok, yes. 5 minutes later and now I'm generating a range of coordinates from
-10 to 10. This way there's a max distance of twenty paces a student may
have to take between coordinate pairs.


Excellent. 5 More minutes and the test data is complete. It's just an array
of arrays and is only 4 items long. Nothing major.
But it seems to be outputting the correct bearings.
I'm going to run outside to test it.


Ok. Yes. The test data works as expected.
So, next steps. I need to generate several sets of random data and try them
out to see if everything is working as expected all the way through.

Then I'll need to pretty up the output and write it out to files.
The first several coordinate sets will go to the student file which will
be a simple document that shows a series made up of a number of steps to
take and the bearing to follow as well as a space to answer the number of
steps and bearing required to get back to the start point.

The other file will be for the teacher which will contain the computed
number of steps and bearing required to return to each start point allowing
the professor to compare the student's findings with those of the computer.


That's all for today. Time to go rock climbing and get out for a night hike!
