**Goal Adjustments** (how you can plan for changes):

- **Easier:**
    - I want to study/code 25 per day for personal/professional growth
      - This can also include my coding challenges that are for my job prep
    - Finish 2 projects from the Data Visualization Course Projects
    - 1/2 of the week will be tomatoz development
- **Medium:**
    - I want to study 45min per day
    - Finish FreeCodeCamp's Data Visualization Course Projects
    - 1/2 of the week will be tomatoz development
    - I would like to get 80% of development done for the tomatoz projects
- **Optimistic:**
    - I want to study 1 hour per day
    - 1/2 of the week will be tomatoz development
    - I want to finish the tomatoz application and deploy it

**One way you want to help** (another participant or the GFC group at large):

- I would like to write out our collective values
- I would like to do daily standups where I am doing my 100 days at that point
